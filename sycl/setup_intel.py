"""setup.py for an Intel Arc: upstream's installer, steered onto the SYCL port from outside.

    ./setup.sh --backend sycl [setup.py's options]       (this file, run through setup.sh's virtual environment)

The SYCL port keeps out of the shared files (upstream merges stay clean), so this does not edit setup.py: it imports
it and replaces the few steps that are NVIDIA/AMD-specific, then runs setup's own main().  Everything else - the
model choice, the download, the pack, the tokenizer, the MTP draft layer, the context and KV questions - is
setup.py's, unchanged.  What is replaced:

  - the GPU check: the Intel Arc is offered through setup's AMD path (the one that compiles locally and has no
    images), named and sized from sysfs;
  - the engine step: the SYCL build (build-sycl-aot/strata, run in the strata-sycl-dev image by
    sycl/serve/strata-sycl.sh; docs/INTEL.md) instead of a CUDA/HIP build;
  - the RAM rule: the CUDA engine keeps every expert in RAM, the SYCL port streams them from the GGUF into VRAM
    (--stream-experts), so RAM only bounds the KV streaming;
  - the config: the container's paths, the SYCL flags, backend "sycl"; the run script starts
    sycl/serve/server_intel.py (serve/server.py plus the Intel Monitor readings and the model menu).

When setup.py changes the steps this relies on, this stops with a message rather than writing a wrong config.
