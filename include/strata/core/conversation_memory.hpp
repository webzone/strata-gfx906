// The RAM a runtime allocation (parking a conversation, saving or restoring a session file) may still take.

// available_host_bytes() is the smallest of
//   * MemAvailable (Windows: the available physical memory);
//   * the room under every memory limit of this process's cgroup and of each ancestor visible under
//     /sys/fs/cgroup (cgroup v2: memory.max and memory.high, each minus usage; cgroup v1:
//     memory.limit_in_bytes minus memory.usage_in_bytes);
//   * the operator's own cap, when one is set (--memory-limit-mib / STRATA_MEMORY_LIMIT_MIB): that many MiB minus
//     what the container uses now - the top visible cgroup's memory.current, or MemTotal - MemAvailable when the
//     cgroup files cannot be read.  For a container whose real limit sits on a parent cgroup it cannot see.
//
// Usage is memory.current as the kernel reports it, less one reclaimable kind: the clean inactive file cache of the
// same group (memory.stat inactive_file, v1 total_inactive_file, less dirty and writeback pages, never more than
// memory.current), which the kernel gives back at memory.high or the limit before it kills anything.  Nothing else is
// credited: active_file holds mlocked pages, and shmem is the pinned complements and the KV pool.  A memory.stat that
// is missing or unparsable gives no credit (it does not make the sample unknown).
// Pinned, locked and shared memory stays charged in full: a hard-limit kill is worse than a skipped park.
//
// Unknown telemetry is deliberately distinct from a measured zero.  A limit file that exists but cannot be parsed
// makes the sample unknown (fail closed); a file that is absent (no such controller, not mounted) is ignored.
// Not a reservation: other writers can take the room after the sample.
